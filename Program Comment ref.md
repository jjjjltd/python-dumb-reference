# Program Comment Reference

### Even by my standards, this might look dumb - but I keep forgetting comment formats for different languages...

## Python

* Hash(#): At start of line - not indent sensitve.
* Block comment/uncomment toggle:  Ctrl + /

## Javascript

* Single line, or to the right of Code: //
* Block:  /* Comments in between */

## HTML

* Single line, or block:  <!-- Comments in between -->

## CSS

* Block:  /* Comments in between */
* Note on CSS comparison operators:
  * ==      (2) Equal, but does not check type.
  * ===     (3)Equal, value and type

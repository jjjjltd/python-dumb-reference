Github Quick Reference

Introduction
This started from a Folder on my PC where I had added a single .py file with some python code in it.  The kind of code I’m putting into this single file is the kind of dumb stuff I forget if I only look at Python once every 6 months, which is roughly what’s happening now.

I then created a repository on Github.com, called “python-dumb-reference”:

From Command Line:
•	git init
o	Set current working directory as a git repository
•	git commit -m "first commit"
o	Do a first commit of anything that’s in there
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/jjjjltd/python-dumb-reference.git
git push -u origin main
